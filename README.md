# [Cozy](http://cozy.io) Emails

Cozy Emails lets you read and write your emails from your Cozy. The project is about to start, here are the main features we want to have:

* Simple UI
* Read/write emails
* Multiple mailboxes
* Attachments management (synced with Files!)


## Install

We assume here that the Cozy platform is correctly [installed](https://docs.cozy.io/en/host/install/) on your server.

### Graphically

You can simply install the Emails application via the app registry. Click on the *Choose Your Apps* button located on the right of your Cozy Home.

### CLI

From the command line you can type this command:

```sh
$ cozy-monitor install emails
```


## Contribution

You can contribute to the Cozy Emails in many ways:

* Pick up an [issue](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-emails/issues?state=open) and solve it.
* Translate it in [a new language](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-emails/tree/master/client/app/locales).

## Hack

Hacking the Emails app requires you [setup a dev environment](https://docs.cozy.io/en/hack/getting-started/). Once it's done you can hack the emails just like it was your own app.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cozy/cozy-emails.git
$ npm install
$ cd client
$ npm install
```

### Development

Run it with:

```sh
$ npm run watch
```

The `watch` task starts 3 daemons:

- the server one, running coffee-script server-side code through a [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) process that reload the server part each time you make a change
- a [node-inspector](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector) process, that let you use the Chome/Chromium devtools applied to your node process and debug it directly [in your browser](http://127.0.0.1:8080/?ws=127.0.0.1:8080&port=5858)
- a [brunch](https://github.com/brunch/brunch) watcher which recompiles and reload through browser-sync your front-end app in your browser each time you make a change

### Build

The build is a part of the publication process, and you'll probably never need it explicitly. If you want to build you app anyway (e.g. to deploy it in a sandboxed cozy for tests purposes), you can achieve a build by running:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

Please, do not push your local builds in your PR, as long as we make the build process when we release the app.


### Naming conventions

We've adopted IMAP naming conventions, which means:
* Account: bound to a provider like Gmail
* Mailbox: equivalent to imap folder
* Message: an email
* Conversation: a thread of Message


## Tests

A tests suite is available. You can run it with:

```sh
npm run test
```

Feel free to adapt/fix/add your own tests in your PR ;).

### Frontend

Tests suite is based on CasperJS. Tests data are loaded by [cozy-fixtures](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-fixtures).

```sh
$ npm run fixtures
```

To run the client's tests, you need to start the server:

```sh
$ npm run watch:server
```

Then you can run the client's tests in another terminal:

```sh
$ npm run test:client
```

### Backend

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cozy/cozy-emails.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cozy/cozy-emails)

Running tests requires a Vagrant. Tests load a Dovecot instance in a Vagrant virtual machine. Make sure your Vagrant box is running, then run:

```sh
$ npm run test:server
```

In order to run the tests, you must only have the Data System started.
The tests wont pass if you already have an account in your data-system

### Mail Loader

Mail loader test is based on the Dovecot Testing repository.
